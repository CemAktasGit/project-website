Version 2.0 Updates

- After submitting a form ("Registration" or "Contact Us") the verification (or error message) is shown in green (red).

- the entries for "Registration" and "Contact Us" are checked before sending it to the database. They are checked for:
    missing entries, valid characters for names and valid email
    
- If an error occurs after clicking "Submit", the user is redirected to the same page for corrections, including an error message
  AND the entries are not deleted so that the user is not forced to type in everything again
