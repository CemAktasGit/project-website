# project-website
This is an own website project for applying and learning HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL etc. It is also thought to further improve these skills by continuously expanding the website by e.g. making it more userfriendly or allowing more option for the user.

The content of the website is randomly chosen. The file index.php contains the "main" part of the main page, and loads "header.php" and "footer.php". 

In html, the php files (containing php and html) for all the other pages of the website are stored (name "html" since at the beginning only html files were used).

In "connect", PHP and MySQL is used to save user entries (in forms) on a local database. To run this part of the website, a local database called "website" is required, including the tables "registration" and "sendmessage" for the forms on the web pages "Registration" and "Contact Us".
